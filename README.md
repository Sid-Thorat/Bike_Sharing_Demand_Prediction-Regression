# Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction-Regression
This repository contains code & documentation of bike rental information about a bike sharing company.The goal is to predict the demand for Bikes based on various weather conditions ,climatic features & ohter attributes.

# Problem Statement
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

# Project Summary
The Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project involved extensive data analysis, data preprocessing and model selection to accurately predict bike counts. Here is a brief overview of the project steps and key findings:

1.Data Exploration & Wrangling
*There are 8760 rows and 14 columns in the dataset.
*No duplicates or missing/null values were found.
